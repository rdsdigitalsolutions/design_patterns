# 🚀 Design Patterns in Python, PHP & Node.js  

This repository provides **clear, practical implementations** of the most widely used **design patterns** in **Python, PHP, and Node.js**. Each pattern is implemented in a structured manner, making it **easy to learn, understand, and apply** in real-world projects.  

## 📌 Why This Repository?  
Design patterns are **proven solutions** to common software design problems. They help developers write **scalable, maintainable, and reusable** code. Whether you’re a **junior developer** learning patterns or a **senior engineer** refining best practices, this repository serves as a **reference guide** for implementing design patterns in different programming languages.

## 📂 Repository Structure  

The repository contains individual folders for each **design pattern**, with implementations in **Python, PHP, and Node.js**.  

    design_patterns/
    │── builder/       # 🏗 Builder Pattern - Step-by-step object construction
    │── factory/       # 🏭 Factory Pattern - Centralized object creation
    │── observer/      # 🔄 Observer Pattern - Event-driven subscriptions
    │── prototype/     # 🧬 Prototype Pattern - Object cloning and duplication
    │── singleton/     # 🔁 Singleton Pattern - Single-instance management
    │── README.md      # 📖 Documentation for the entire repository


Each folder includes:  
- 📜 **Code implementations** in Python, PHP, and Node.js  
- 📖 **A README.md file** explaining the pattern and its use cases  
- 🏗 **Example usage** demonstrating the pattern in action

## 🔥 Available Design Patterns  

### **1️⃣ Factory Pattern 🏭**  
**Purpose:** Encapsulates object creation logic, allowing dynamic instantiation of different object types.  
**Use Case:** When the exact type of object to create is determined at runtime.  
📂 [Factory Pattern Code](./factory/)  

### **2️⃣ Builder Pattern 🏗**  
**Purpose:** Constructs complex objects step by step, improving readability and flexibility.  
**Use Case:** When an object requires multiple configurations before instantiation.  
📂 [Builder Pattern Code](./builder/)  

### **3️⃣ Observer Pattern 🔄**  
**Purpose:** Implements a subscription mechanism, where multiple objects get notified of state changes in another object.  
**Use Case:** Event-driven applications, pub-sub systems, UI frameworks.  
📂 [Observer Pattern Code](./observer/)  

### **4️⃣ Prototype Pattern 🧬**  
**Purpose:** Enables object duplication instead of creating new instances from scratch.  
**Use Case:** When object creation is expensive and duplication is more efficient.  
📂 [Prototype Pattern Code](./prototype/)  

### **5️⃣ Singleton Pattern 🔁**  
**Purpose:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.  
**Use Case:** Managing shared resources like logging, configuration, or database connections.  

📂 [Singleton Pattern Code](./singleton/)
